# Techno-Economic Analysis of Wind and Solar Energy Systems using NREL SAM

This repository contains a comparative techno-economic assessment of utility-scale wind and photovoltaic power systems at Astoria, Oregon and Portland, Maine using NREL’s System Advisor Model (SAM).

## Methodology
- Wind and PV system modeling using NREL SAM
- Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) based financial analysis
- Parametric optimization of APP, tilt angle, and azimuth
- Evaluation using NPV, IRR, and LCOE

## Tools Used
- NREL System Advisor Model (SAM)
- Microsoft Excel

## My Contribution
- System setup and simulations in NREL SAM
- Parametric optimization studies
- Financial and performance analysis
- Report preparation

## Team and Status
Group academic project, undergraduate level, 2025
